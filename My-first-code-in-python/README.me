My-first-code-in-python
# Hello!! I want to share my first code in python. I'm very happy because I had never programmed before . It may not seem like much, but it means a lot to me.

It's a simple code that finds lines starting with "From:" extracts those lines and counts them all.

When prompted type 'mbox-short.txt'   🔥🔥
